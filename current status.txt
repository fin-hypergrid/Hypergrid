current status

Overall we are in good shape for an end of october release of the openfin grid component.
There are only a few anxiety points left for me that I plan on exploring today and over the
weekend.  An important point to make is that we now have a clear path toward easily shareable module-based javascript code organization.  So far there are 3 sub-projects that have been created which provide support code for the openfin grid control project.

We should talk about each of the items on the below checklist to avoid ambiguity...

*'s denote semi-optional, meaning we can go with these items in there current state
